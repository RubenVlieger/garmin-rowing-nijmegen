# Privacy Policy

I value your privacy and aim to collect the absolute minimum amount of data required to understand how many people are using this project.

## 1. Data Collection

When your Garmin watch fetches weather data from my server, I log the following **anonymous** information:

* **Hashed IP address**: Your IP is combined with a daily-rotating random salt and hashed using SHA-256. The resulting anonymous identifier cannot be traced back to your IP address.
* **Country code**: Your IP is used to determine your country (e.g., "NL") via an offline database. No city, region, or precise location is ever stored.

No personal data, device identifiers, Garmin account information, or browsing history is collected.

## 2. Purpose of Processing

This data is used for **one purpose only**:

* To maintain an aggregate count of daily unique visitors and their countries (analytics).

I do **not** use this information to identify you personally, track your activity across other websites, or build a behavioral profile.

## 3. Data Retention

* **Daily hashed identifiers** are stored for a maximum of **90 days**, after which log files are automatically deleted.
* The daily salt used for hashing rotates every 24 hours, making it impossible to correlate your identity across different days.
* Only **aggregate summaries** (total visitor counts and country distributions) are retained long-term.

## 4. Third Parties

* **No third-party analytics services** are used. All processing happens on my own server.
* **MaxMind GeoLite2**: An offline IP-to-country database is used locally on the server. Your IP is never sent to MaxMind or any external service.
* **No Sale of Data**: I do not sell, rent, or share your data with any third-party advertisers or data brokers.
