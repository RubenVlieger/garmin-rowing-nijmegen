# Privacy Policy

I value your privacy and aim to collect the absolute minimum amount of data required to understand how many people are using this project.

## 1. Data Collection & Fingerprinting

To keep an accurate count of unique visitors without requiring accounts or invasive tracking, I use a **Cloudflare proxy** to generate a basic digital fingerprint. This process looks at standard browser and network attributes to distinguish between different users.

## 2. Purpose of Processing

This data is used for **one purpose only**:

* To maintain an aggregate count of unique visitors (analytics).

I do **not** use this information to identify you personally, track your activity across other websites, or build a behavioral profile.

## 3. Data Retention

Your fingerprint data is stored for a maximum of **24 hours**. After this period, the data is automatically deleted. I only retain the final, anonymous "total visitor count" for long-term project metrics.

## 4. Third Parties

* **Cloudflare:** As the proxy provider, Cloudflare processes network traffic to provide this service.
* **No Sale of Data:** I do not sell, rent, or share your data with any third-party advertisers or data brokers.

## 5. Contact

If you have questions about how this data is handled, feel free to email me at ruben.vlieger@ru.nl
